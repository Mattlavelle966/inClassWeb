    <h2>Grapic Design</h2>
    <p> 
        My name is Amelia,
        I am a freelance graphic designer and a pony-mad girl.
        My specialty is logo design & branding for horse related businesses - coaches, grooms, professional riders, yards, physios, vets, farriers...younameit!        
        Having been immersed in the horse world since I was a kid, it is easy for me to understand the nature of the various equine businesses and therefore to capture their mission with the design.
        My logos are entirely bespoke and I never use stock images : every logo is crafted uniquely for the individual business.
        Although horses are my main focus,I have had happy clients from other sectors and I am always enthusiastic about taking on new challenges-so dont hesitate to contact me even if you have no thing to do with horses!
        Looking forward to meeting you.
